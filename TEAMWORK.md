# TEAMWORK Guidelines

Our team is committed to a smooth and efficient workflow. Here are the guidelines we've set for our collaboration:

## 1. Division of Labour

- **Research**: Assigned to Alice. Alice will conduct the initial research on the topic and outline the main points.
- **Writing**: Assigned to Bob. Based on Alice's research, Bob will write the content.
- **Review**: Both Alice and Bob will review and refine the content. Each teammate will review the other's pull request.

## 2. Timing

- **Minghao**: Aims to submit his pull request by **Wednesday, 5 pm** (changes will made after discussion).
- **Maxon**: Aims to submit his pull request by **Thursday, 12 pm** (changes will made after discussion).
- **Yian**: Given the dependencies between the tasks, we're mindful of not waiting until the last minute.
> The aim is to complete Exercise 3 and 4 as soon as possible. So each team member can have sufficient time for reviewing, commenting, and debugging.

## 3. Communication

- **Primary Channel**: Slack for real-time communication, immediate clarifications, and scheduling meetings.
- **Secondary Channel**: GitHub Issues for tracking bugs, tasks, and requests.
- **Response Time**: We'll aim to respond to any related issues within 4 hours during the day.
- **Meetings**: We will hold a meeting on _Thursday, Sept. 21st at 11am_ to work on the project together. For other discussions, we'll rely on asynchronous communication.
